There were 6 assignments in the semester. Though it was called "assignments", it was more likely the online test without the judgment. You need to demonstrate you program to TAs and get the score.

The scores mainly depend on the time you spent, and then the performance. If you finish the assignment during the class, you'll get full score.

All of the directories contain a note written only in Chinese, recording some of the points of the assignment. Besides, a website is recorded in the note, which is the spec of the assignment. But I can't guarantee that the page will always be accessible. Maybe professor will close the website in someday.

> 國立陽明交通大學 113 學年度上學期，網路程式設計概論。

學期間有六次作業，雖然稱作作業，實際是更像是沒有 OJ 的上機考。需要跟助教 demo 才有成績。

成績主要根據花費時間，其次才是程式的正確性。在課堂上寫完拿滿分。

所有資料夾底下都有一份只有以中文撰寫的筆記，紀錄該次作業的部分重點。此外，筆記中會有一份網址，是該次作業的題目敘述。但我無法保證這些網頁以後也可以看到，或許某天教授會把他關起來。
