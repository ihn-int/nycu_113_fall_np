There were 5 assignments in the semester. Though it was called "assignments", it was more likely the online test without the judgment. You need to demonstrate you program to TAs and get the score.

The scores mainly depend on the time you spent, and then the performance.

All of the directories contain a note written only in Chinese, recording some of the points of the assignment.

## 中文版本

> 國立陽明交通大學 113 學年度上學期，網路程式設計概論。

學期間有五次作業，雖然稱作作業，實際是更像是沒有 OJ 的上機考。需要跟助教 demo 才有成績。

成績主要根據花費時間，其次才是程式的正確性。

所有資料夾底下都有一份只有以中文傳的筆記，紀錄該次作業的部分重點。
